Paragraph 211 (middle east conflict):
      In another alarming incident, US forces this week sank three boats belonging to Houthi rebelsÂ in the Red Sea, following a series of attacks on commercial shipping. Central Command said American helicopters were fired on first and acted in self-defense. The US and around a dozen allies have launched a maritime task force to protect commercial vessels in critical sea lanes in the area after some shipping firms sent their vessels on a longer, less economical route around Africa.
